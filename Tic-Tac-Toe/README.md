# Tic-Tac-Toe


This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Python. The game allows two players to compete against each other on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking spaces on the grid with their respective symbols (usually 'X' and 'O') until one player achieves a winning pattern or the grid is filled with no winner, resulting in a draw.

### Features

Interactive Gameplay:
Enjoy a user-friendly interface that allows players to input their moves via the command line.
Two-Player Mode: 
Play against a friend locally, taking turns to make moves and compete for victory.
Winning Detection: 
The game automatically detects winning patterns (three consecutive symbols in a row, column, or diagonal) and declares the winner.
Draw Detection: 
If the grid fills up with no winner, the game ends in a draw.
Restart Option: 
After the game ends, players have the option to restart and play again.
